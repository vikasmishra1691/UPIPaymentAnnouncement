BUILD SUCCESSFUL in XXs
```

## ⚙️ First Time Setup (IMPORTANT!)

### 1. Grant Notification Access
When you first open the app:
1. You'll see a RED card saying "Service Inactive"
2. Tap the white button "Enable Access"
3. You'll be taken to Settings
4. Find "SoundPay" in the list
5. Toggle it ON
6. Press back to return to app
7. Card should now be GREEN "Service Active" ✅

### 2. Configure (Optional)
Tap the ⚙️ Settings icon:
- **Enable Announcements**: ON (required for voice)
- **Language**: English or Hindi
- **Volume Boost**: ON (recommended)
- **Auto Start on Boot**: ON (recommended)

## 🧪 Test It!

### Option 1: Real Payment
1. Ask someone to send you ₹1 via UPI
2. When notification arrives, you'll hear:
   - "Payment received of rupees 1 from [Name]"
3. Check History screen - payment will be logged

### Option 2: Simulate Notification (Advanced)
You can use ADB to send a test notification, but real payment is easier.
