### When ANY notification arrives:

```
Step 1: Check App Package
   Is it from UPI app list?
      ✅ YES → Continue to Step 2
      ❌ NO  → IGNORE & STOP

Step 2: Check Payment Type
   Contains "received/credited"?
      ✅ YES → Continue to Step 3
      ❌ NO  → IGNORE & STOP
   
   Contains "sent/debited"?
      ✅ YES → IGNORE & STOP
      ❌ NO  → Continue to Step 3

Step 3: Verify Currency
   Contains ₹ or Rs or INR?
      ✅ YES → Continue to Step 4
      ❌ NO  → IGNORE & STOP

Step 4: Verify Context
   Contains "UPI" or "payment"?
      ✅ YES → ANNOUNCE!
      ❌ NO  → IGNORE & STOP
```
