# ✅ UPI App Filtering & Hindi Language - FIXED

## Changes Made:

### 1. ✅ **Enhanced UPI App Detection**
   - **File**: `PaymentNotificationListener.kt`
   - **What was done**:
     - ✓ App ONLY reads notifications from verified UPI apps
     - ✓ Added 18+ UPI apps including major banks
     - ✓ Ignores all non-UPI app notifications

### 2. ✅ **Improved Payment Detection Logic**
   - **More robust filtering**:
     - ✓ Detects "received" payments only (not sent)
     - ✓ Excludes "sent", "debited", "paid to" notifications
     - ✓ Requires UPI/payment context keywords
     - ✓ Must contain currency symbols (₹, Rs, INR)
   
### 3. ✅ **Fixed Hindi Language Announcements**
   - **File**: `PaymentAnnouncementService.kt`
   - **What was fixed**:
     - ✓ Changed from English to proper Hindi text
     - ✓ Uses Devanagari script: "रुपये प्राप्त हुए"
     - ✓ TTS engine will now speak in Hindi properly

### 4. ✅ **Enhanced Logging**
   - Added debug logs to show:
     - Which app notification came from
     - Whether it passed UPI app filter
     - Whether it was detected as payment received
     - Parsed payment amount and sender

## How It Works:

### Step 1: Notification Received
```
Notification from ANY app → PaymentNotificationListener
```

### Step 2: UPI App Filter
```
Is package name in UPI apps list?
   ✓ YES → Continue to Step 3
   ✗ NO  → IGNORE (log and skip)
```

### Step 3: Payment Type Detection
```
Check notification text:
   ✓ Contains "received/credited" keywords → Continue
   ✗ Contains "sent/debited" keywords → IGNORE
   ✗ No currency symbol → IGNORE
   ✗ No UPI context → IGNORE
```

### Step 4: Parse & Announce
```
Extract amount and sender name
   ↓
Save to database
   ↓
Announce in selected language (English/Hindi)
```

## What This Fixes:

### ❌ Before:
- Could process notifications from non-UPI apps
- Hindi announcement used English words
- Would announce sent payments too
- Less robust payment detection

### ✅ After:
- **ONLY processes UPI app notifications**
- **ONLY announces received payments** (not sent)
- **Proper Hindi announcements** with Devanagari script
- **Robust multi-layer filtering**

---

## Testing:

1. **Test with UPI apps**:
   - Send yourself a payment via PhonePe/Google Pay
   - App should announce: "₹500 रुपये प्राप्त हुए" (in Hindi)
   - Or: "Payment received of ₹500" (in English)

2. **Test with non-UPI apps**:
   - Get notification from WhatsApp/Instagram/etc
   - App should IGNORE it completely

3. **Test sent payments**:
   - Send money to someone
   - App should IGNORE the "sent" notification

4. **Check logs**:
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep PaymentNotificationListener
   ```
   - See which apps are filtered
   - See detection results

## Language Settings:

### English Announcement:
```
"Payment received of ₹500 from John"
```

### Hindi Announcement:
```
"₹500 रुपये John से प्राप्त हुए"
(TTS will speak this in Hindi voice)
```
